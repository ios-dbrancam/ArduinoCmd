# How it works

- Download the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/es/developer/david-brana-campos/id1047286431)

- Download and install the [WebServer Library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/WebServer)

- Copy the code from this [GitHub page](https://github.com/ios-dbrancam/ArduinoCmd/blob/master/ESP32/Demo%20Code%20v.1.1) to a new Arduino Sketch

- You need to modify some things of the sketch
  - Change lines *15 .. 16* to your current WiFi network name and password
    - `const char* ssid = "YOUR_NETWORK_NAME";`
    - `const char* password = "YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD"`
  - Change lines *27 .. 30* to your IP Address values. If you don't know this value, connect your iPhone to the same network as the ESP32 and go to **Preferences > Wi-Fi > (i)** on the WiFi network and there you will find the values. *Router -> gateway; Subnet Mask -> subnet; DNS -> primaryDNS and secondaryDNS.*
    - `IPAddress gateway(192,168,1,1);`
    - `IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);`
    - `IPAddress primaryDNS(80, 58, 62, 250);`
    - `IPAddress secondaryDNS(80, 58, 62, 254);`

- Upload the sketch

- Follow the schematic to connect a LED and a Potentiometer to the ESP32

- Open **ArduinoCmd**, you will find four *nodes* on the Main Screen. The first one displays the value read from the potentiometer (slide down to update the value). The second and third one control the LED, you will be able to blink the LED by pressing the button or toggling the state with the switch. *It's not possible to use PWM and digitalWrite on the ESP32 at the same time so the fourth node is disabled on the Sketch. If the Main Screen is empty it's possible to restart the tutorial from the Preferences View.*
